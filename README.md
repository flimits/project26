# project26
- This project was to make a simple page with a picture or caption surrounded by some kind of boarder.
- There should be a blurb about the image and there should be some contact information within in it.

## Where to find this site

You can find this site at [Project 26](https://flimits.github.io/project26/)

## Issues

I had a problem with centering the contact information after creating a border was not working like I 
was thinking. Also creating the contact infomation looked confusing to me. I'll need to read up more on the idea of a form.
